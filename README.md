## Product

IntuiTeach is a web app combined with Zoom that allows teachers to write a series a questions for a virtual lecture they're about to give and as the lecture progresses, the teacher is able to pose a live question for the students on the video call for them to answer. IntuiTeach also aims to improve engagement for younger learners by incentivizing correct answers with rewards. Each question can hold a certain number of points determined by the teacher which can then be converted into rewards that are also made by the teacher (i.e. extra credit). Also, it would increase the teacher’s ability to gauge the students’ understanding by providing them with in depth statistics about the time taken by students to answer, and the accuracy of the class. Developers can expand on our base with our flexible API to track a teacher’s question sets and student statistics so that it can be integrated to different platforms, for example a mobile app. Through our navbar at the top, teachers will create meetings through the Zoom API, be authenticated, and have their data stored in the API's we designed in our Mongo database. From there, students will be able to join through the meeting id which redirects them to the specific meeting they requesting to join, again handled by our API.
